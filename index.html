<p>At the begginning of 2021 I had finished my bachelors thesis for Computer Science. My project was focused on comparing two important models for detecting and classifying objects in images using machine learning, YOLOv4 and Faster R-CNN. The projects were originally written in python using google colabs Jupyter Notebooks and run on Google Colab pro's T4 GPU's. The linked github page contains the original jupyter files to run in colab along with the thesis pdf and instructions on how to run the comparison yourself.</p>
